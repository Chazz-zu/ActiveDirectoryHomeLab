<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I used VMware Workstation to install Windows Server 2022. The process included creating a new virtual machine, configuring the necessary hardware settings, and mounting the Windows Server 2022 ISO file. Following the installation prompts, I successfully set up a fully functional Windows Server environment. This virtual server is ideal for testing, learning, and development purposes, providing a robust platform to explore Windows Server capabilities.
